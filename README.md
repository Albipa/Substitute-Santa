## Objective

The objective was to make a program that could make and read wishlists, as well as read the naughty list and append names to it.

## Function

This program is able to make and read wishlists. It is also able to analyze the naughty list and add names of people who deserve eternal suffering and pain.

## What I've Learned

I've Learned to make and edit files through python code, which will be very useful to make more advanced code and scripts in the future.
